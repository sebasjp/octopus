# OctopusML: A workflow for AutoML

OctopusML is a Machine Learning Workflow proposed in Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. One task of a Machine Learning Engineer is to design and build applications that automate the execution of predictive models. The goal of this project is to implement a machine learning workflow to increase the efficiency in supervised learning specifically in binary classification problems. The idea is that it can be seen like a baseline for any Data Analyst or Data Scientist.
